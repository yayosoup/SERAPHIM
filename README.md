S>E>R>A>P>H>I>M is a project I started to learn Garry's Mod and LUA. It's scripts are now open source to use, but some may still be in progress. 
A Garry's Mod Server is required to see these scripts, find out here how to make one for free:

* Event Scoreboard obviously inspired by THE FINALS game, which also includes a Law Board and Money Scoreboard
* Events system with PURGE event already built
* Multiple DarkRP jobs, such as the Crusader/Martyr
* Low Health "return to homeostasis" indicator, inspired by Modern Warfare 2019
* Crafting System "IN PROGRESS"
* QUESTS FROM GOD!! (Random Quest system for player retention)
* Mutation Trait system with buyable currency that persists beyond play sessions
